I'm starting a #100DaysOfCode challenge to motivate me to complete my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. As part of the challenge, I'll be working thorough some of the FreeCodeCamp projects as well as the tutorials. I'm about halfway through the tutorials already, before I start this project.

You can follow along with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ilaeria) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Ilaeria).
