# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Introduction

I'm starting a #100DaysOfCode challenge to motivate me to complete my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. As part of the challenge, I'll be working thorough some of the freeCodeCamp projects as well as the tutorials. I'm about halfway through the tutorials already, before I start this project.

The log will be presented in reverse chronological order (latest updates at the top).

You can follow along with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ilaeria) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Ilaeria).

## Logs

### Day 8: 26 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed the FCC RWD CSS Grid module. Now the only thing left for this certification is the final 3 projects, so that will be my focus for #100DaysOfCode until I complete them.
* Started setting up the next project: a product landing page.

**Thoughts**

Naturally, I had Christmas Day off. Hoping that is my last day off for a while though. I'm excited I've finished the learning modules for FCC RWD and can focus on the projects now.

### Day 7: 24 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed the next FCC RWD module: CSS Flexbox. Only CSS Grid to go in the lessons.
* Completed my survey form enough to submit it. I might come back and make it better later.
* Submitted survey form project. 2/5 Responsive Web Design Projects complete!

**Thoughts**

Christmas week means a change of routine and I forget everything except Christmas-related activities. So I missed another day yesterday. Oops!

### Day 6: 22 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed the next FCC RWD module: Responsive Web Design Principles.
* Continued prettying up my survey form.

**Thoughts**

I went a little off the rails this week, but it **is** the week before Christmas. In hindsight, maybe it wasn't a great idea to start this challenge at this time of year. Oh well! A few days off and now back in to it.

### Day 5: 16 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed the next FCC RWD module: Applied Accessibility.
* Completed the skeleton of my survey page. All tests now passing. Now it needs to be prettied up.

**Thoughts**

I missed my first day yesterday, for various reasons. I'm not going to beat myself up over it, but I've added a "Days missed" counter to the bottom of the log so I can still hold myself accountable.

80s jams while coding make everything better.

### Day 4: 14 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Set up GitHub Pages site.
* Set up next FCC RWD project - build a survey form.
* Started work on the survey form.
* Completed FCC RWD Applied Visual Design module.

**Thoughts**

Making good progress with the FCC RWD modules - just applied accessibility, responsive web design principles, flexbox, and grid to go - and then the rest of the projects. I'm happy with my approach of doing a little bit of learning and a little bit of coding each day for this challenge.

### Day 3: 13 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Completed my tribute page.

**Thoughts**

It was really interesting to create the content for the page and to learn more about Ada Lovelace. I enjoyed the project.

### Day 2: 12 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Chose a color palette.
* Completed a few more lessons in the Applied Visual Design section of the FCC RWD certification.
* Started styling up my tribute page.

**Thoughts**

Sure, the tests were passing, but the page looked rubbish. Spending some time on some basic styling was fun and refreshed my memory on some basic CSS.

### Day 1: 11 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Set up log project in GitHub.
* Set up freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design tribute page project in GitHub. 
* Set up workspace in VS Code.
* Created skeleton HTML and CSS.
* All FCC tribute page tests passing.

**Thoughts**

I went back and forth on what IDE to use and decided to just stick with simple VS Code for now. I was a bit frustrated getting everything to work and reminding myself how to use VS Code and GitHub but I got there in the end.
