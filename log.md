# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Introduction

I'm starting a #100DaysOfCode challenge to motivate me to complete my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. As part of the challenge, I'll be working thorough some of the FreeCodeCamp projects as well as the tutorials. I'm about halfway through the tutorials already, before I start this project.

You can follow along with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ilaeria) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Ilaeria).

### Day 1: 11 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Set up log project in GitHub.
* Set up FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design tribute page project in GitHub. 
* Set up workspace in VS Code.
* Created skeleton HTML and CSS.
* All FCC tribute page tests passing.

**Thoughts**

I went back and forth on what IDE to use and decided to just stick with simple VS Code for now. I was a bit frustrated getting everything to work and reminding myself how to use VS Code and GitHub but I got there in the end.

### Day 2: 12 December 2019

**Today's Progress**

* Chose a color palette.
* Completed a few more lessons in the Applied Visual Design section of the FCC RWD certification.
* Started styling up my tribute page.

**Thoughts**

Sure, the tests were passing, but the page looked rubbish. Spending some time on some basic styling was fun and refreshed my memory on some basic CSS.
